# Candy Dungeon™ Trademarks

“Candy Dungeon”, the Candy Dungeon logo, and related brand assets are trademarks of **David Hagar / Lorecache Labs**.

---

## What you may do (no permission needed)

- Refer to the project in a **descriptive** way (for example: “a fork of Candy Dungeon” or “compatible with Candy Dungeon”).
- Link to the **official repository** and **official releases**.

---

## What you may not do without written permission

- Name your fork, product, distribution, or service **“Candy Dungeon”** (or anything confusingly similar).
- Use the Candy Dungeon **logo** or **branding** in your fork/product.
- Imply that your build is **official**, **endorsed**, or **produced by** the Candy Dungeon project.

## Forks and modified builds

- If you distribute a modified version, you must use a **different name** and remove Candy Dungeon **branding/logos**.

---

## Why this policy exists

We use trademark rules to protect users from **confusion**, **fraud**, or **malware** distributed under the Candy Dungeon name, and because the creator retains rights to the name for use in other products.
